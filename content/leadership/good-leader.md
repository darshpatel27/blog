If you are planning to become an Engineering leader or have already stepped in to
being one, I am sure this is one questions that you will keep coming back to

It is something that i have wondered / explored a lot about. Talking to leaders
that i look up to, reading things online and a lot of analysis of how my
journey has been.

If i have to sum it up, I would say is the intersection of 3 things that defines how
good an engineering leader you are going to be

1. Technical Knowledge
2. People Skills
3. Business Understanding
